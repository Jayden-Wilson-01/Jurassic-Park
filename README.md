# Jurassic Park
This project is a continuously developed console app that takes inspiration from the *Jurassic Park* film and novel.  
The console app works like the one seen in the movie where Ray Arnold tries to turn the security systems back on.  
Currently, you can enter commands into the console that may or may not show a resultâ€”based on whether the console is in "hacked" mode, which is enabled at a random interval between 1 and 5 minutes.

## Clone Repository
1. Open the command prompt in the directory where you wish to clone the repository.
2. Enter the command: `git clone https://github.com/Jayden-Wilson-01/Jurassic-Park.git`
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio under `...\Jurassic-Park\Jurassic-Park-Console\Jurassic-Park-Console.sln`.
4. Click *Run* to test it out and explore the source code! Make sure you have .NET 5.0 or higher installed and are using a Windows operating system.

## How to Use
Below is a list of commands that you can currently use and what they return:

1. `Access security` - state of the security grid.
2. `Access main security` - state of the security grid.
3. `Access main security grid` - state of the security grid.

To use a command, type the command after `> "command"`.
